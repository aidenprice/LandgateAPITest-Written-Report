# Response to Feedback

## Paraphrasing formatting feedback from Lori Patterson

[ ] Figures should be numbered by the chapter then their order within each rather than in order throughout the whole document
Changed figure and table numbering schemes.



## Paraphrasing the feedback from Dr McMeekin

[ ] Past tense in Related Work section
Rewrote such that present tense or continuous tense verbs became past, discontinuous. Mostly minor changes, lead to much greater consistency of tenses through the section.


[ ] Reference figures in text by their figure number rather than relative references such as "The figure below"



[ ] Abstract does not flow well
Rewrote significant parts, added metric, in accordance with advice mentioned the significance of solving the issue at hand.

[ ] Explain HTTP response codes
Moved and expanded explanation of codes from the Methods section to the background discussion of web services in the introduction. Cited references to add weight to section.

[ ] Add sentences to conclude the introduction and lead into the rest of the work
Paragraph added to summarise and lead into the Related work section.

[ ] Meaning to Landgate
Expanded section on user acceptance of mobile mapping applications. Referred to it in discussion, recommendations and conclusions.

[ ] Expand the Recommendations section
Rewrote some smaller parts, now three paragraphs instead of two. Unable to offer any recommendations that would improve their response time or decrease their error rate as it is outside my area of expertise.

[ ] Need illustrations to help make sense of data model structure and application design.
Created a UML Class diagram of LandgateAPITest's data model and a UML State diagram of the mobile application's inner workings.
