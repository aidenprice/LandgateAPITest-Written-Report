# Response to Feedback

The external examiner's comments were received from my supervisor on Monday, 4th of July, 2016.

The examiner's comments are quoted verbatim below. They have been rearranged such that thematically similar comments are placed adjacent one another. This facilitates a single reply to several otherwise disparate comments.

## Grammar

>However, literature review clearly explains current methods and approaches to address similar issues, some important grammar and critical punctuations have been neglected which causes misunderstanding method and technical issues in this thesis.

>Punctuation and some Academic Writing Requirements did not Considered Properly

Simply state in your review of addressing the grammatical issues, state that you have made all corrections throughout the thesis. Colloquialisms have been removed and a stronger academic wording has been used in its place.

With academic writing the examiner may have been meaning that diagrams should be place in the middle of a page with text above and below only and not on the side of it.

>A list of abbreviation is necessary for research purpose and helpful for reader.

The paragraph starting with “The emergence of RESTful web services engendered…” if you can add a few  citations here that would show that there are many studies.
