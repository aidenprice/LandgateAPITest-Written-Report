# Response to Feedback

The external examiner's comments were received from my supervisor on Monday, 4th of July, 2016.

The examiner's comments are quoted verbatim below. They have been rearranged such that thematically similar comments are placed adjacent one another. This facilitates a single reply to several comments.

## Grammar

>However, literature review clearly explains current methods and approaches to address similar issues, some important grammar and critical punctuations have been neglected which causes misunderstanding method and technical issues in this thesis.

>Punctuation and some Academic Writing Requirements did not Considered Properly

Reviewed language throughout the document to locate grammatical and punctuation issues. Colloquialisms removed and more professionally academic wording applied.

## Abbreviations

>Strongly recommend inserting Abbreviations list and Appendix for codes .

>A list of abbreviation is necessary for research purpose and helpful for reader.

>APPENDIX chapter including codes can be helpful for future development by other researchers.

>Abbreviation lists and appendix of codes are necessary

A reasonable suggestion which the reader will find implemented as "Appendix-C List of Abbreviations". This is a list of all acronyms found in the document and their expanded versions.

Also added a subsection to the appendix listing HTTP methods. These are, by convention, written in all capitals. This could lead the reader to the mistaken impression that they are acronyms.

## Technical Expressions

>In addition, candidate has ignored to explain briefly about several technical expressions before using them.

>Some technical expressions in results  were never used before.

Improved description of Leaflet JavaScript mapping library in "Python Open Source Packages" section.

Disambiguation in the List of Abbreviations is a further aid to understanding, particularly for confusingly abbreviated mobile network standard names in the "Results" section.

## Referencing

>Some parts need more referencing

Added references to topic sentences in opening paragraphs of "Related Work" subsections 2.1 and 2.2.

Removed some motherhood statements. Lead in sentences which state the obvious and do nothing to add to the context.

## Introduction

>Introduction can be divided to two sections as introduction and Concepts

Added a new Heading Level 1 section named "Concepts" to separate the "Web Services" and following Heading Level 2 sections from the "Introduction" section proper.

## Levels of Testing

>It would be helpful to briefly indicate 4 major testing levels in this researches

There is insufficient time to expand the scope of the work to include discussion of the four levels of testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing and acceptance testings). A tester could apply LandgateAPITest to any, or all, of the levels.

Added extra discussion on the testing approach, situations , times and so forth.
